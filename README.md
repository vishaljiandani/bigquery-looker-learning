This is a simple repo to improve my knowledge of Looker and Google BigQuery. They're both a part of the Google Cloud Platform. Looker was acquired by Google in 2019.

I'm going to be using the San Francisco bike dataset from Google's public datasets.

There are basically 4 files in this repo:

1. A file to document data quality issues, table descriptions and any recommendations that I have.
2. A file with a list of questions that I've answered in relation to the data, by way of SQL queries.
3. A file with a single query that feeds a Looker visual.
4. The Looker visual itself (Coming Soon).

Happy reading!
